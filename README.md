<h1>My Project</h1>
<p>Weathersbee is a simple desktop app to display the current weather and temperature at your location!</p>

<h3>Nuts and Bolts</h3>
<p>Weathersbee is built in VS Code using Electron.</p>
<p><i>Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</i></p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This widget is straight forward, to display current weather and temperature with a fun spin - animations and personal artwork.</p> 
<p>This is my first project using Electron, and serves to get a better feel for how it works, as well as designing UI/UX. </p>
